*** Standard lacrosse ball
This was a very high quality purchase I must of made back in 2015. I can't believe I even have it kicking around after all these years. It was all of $5 and it gives my feet a nice massage at the end of long days. It can also be used for it's original purpose if you know how to play lacrosse. The next time you're at any sort of sports store and you see one of these for sale, please buy one.
