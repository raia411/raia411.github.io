I'd like to preface this discussion with a few words about my relationship with mathematics. I definately do not want to come across as if the solution to our struggles with this topic can be vanquished in a 10 minute blog post. That being said, I believe that everyone can practice and enjoy math at a much higher level than they are currently experiencing.
